Glad to see you here. My name is Xinmiao (Mia) Yu. Currently, I’m a double-degree Master student at Politecnico di Milano and Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by [Prof.Bing Qin](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~qinb/) and [Prof.Xiaocheng Feng](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~xcfeng/). My current reasearch focuses on Natural language processing and multimodal generation. More specificly,
1. Vision-language comprehension
   Focus on adapting Stable-diffusion model to story visualization task which generate consistent pictures to depict long story.
2. Generative agents
   Focusing on how to using LLM's emergent abilities such as ICL and CoT to solve knowledge reasoning and decision, includes embodied agents in robotics environment and generative agents' interaction in open text world.
